üìã Problem Description

This project aims to develop an intelligent system that provides personalized shoe recommendations and tailored services to users. By leveraging user interaction data, shoe attributes, and user profiles, the system moves beyond generic suggestions to create a deeply personal and engaging customer experience. The goal is to improve user satisfaction, drive sales, and build brand loyalty through smart, data-driven features.
üöÄ Project Objective

    Build a robust deep learning model capable of recommending shoes based on a hybrid of user behavior and product attributes.

    Design and outline the logic for personalized services, such as proactive care notifications and timely replacement suggestions.

    Develop a scalable and efficient database schema to support the data requirements of the recommendation and personalization systems.

    Create an interactive web application to clearly demonstrate the project's functionality and business value.

üìä Dataset

For initial development and testing, a synthetic dataset located in the /data directory is used. This dataset simulates real-world data streams and consists of three files:

    users.csv: Contains user profiles, including ID, age, gender, and primary_usage.

    shoes.csv: Represents the product catalog with attributes like brand, type, material, and specialized fields for personalized services (care_instructions, lifespan_days).

    interactions.csv: A log of weighted user actions (view, add_to_wishlist, purchase), which forms the basis for the behavioral analysis.

üìà Solution Approach

The project is executed through a series of structured steps, from data modeling to deployment.

    Data Modeling & Schema Design

        Design a normalized PostgreSQL schema with tables for users, shoes, and interactions.

        Include columns that directly support business logic (e.g., lifespan_days).

        Add indexes on foreign keys (user_id, shoe_id) for performance at scale.

    Recommendation Algorithm (Hybrid Model)

        Collaborative Filtering: Use SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) on the user-item interaction matrix to capture latent user tastes.

        Content-Based Filtering: Use TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity on shoe attributes to find items similar to a user's known preferences.

        Combine the scores from both models using a weighted average for a final, robust recommendation.

    Personalized Service Logic

        Care Notifications: Create logic that triggers a notification with care instructions a set time after a purchase.

        Replacement Suggestions: Develop logic that identifies when a shoe is nearing its estimated end-of-life and suggests similar items as replacements.

    Demonstration

        Build an interactive web application using Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for the system.

        Allow users to be selected to view their unique, personalized recommendations and service messages.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

    Python 3.9+

    TensorFlow / Keras (or in our case, Scikit-learn & SciPy for the recommender)

    Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

    Streamlit (for the web application)

    Jupyter Notebook (can be used for prototyping, though not in the final structure)

üí° Results

    The Hybrid Model successfully generates relevant recommendations, mitigating the cold-start problem inherent in single-algorithm systems.

    The Personalized Service Logic provides a clear framework for features that enhance user engagement and drive business value.

    The final Streamlit application serves as an effective proof-of-concept, demonstrating the real-world application of the system in a user-friendly manner.

    These results demonstrate the feasibility and power of using a multi-faceted, data-driven approach to create a superior customer experience.
